# darkaddons-site

This a very simple static website (if it can even be called that, since its just a single txt file) deployed to Netlify on a Free Plan. At the moment it's only purpose is to host the latest version of the mod, to be used inside the mod's Update Checker feature.

However, in the future, it might be changed and extended to:
 - Use a JSON or another format that shows changelog, download link, or seperate latest releases per update channels. (like Stable channel showing the latest stable release, and a Beta channel showing the latest beta release)
 - Have an actual index file that makes it a proper website that shows highlighted features of the mod, a FAQ, contact information, etc. about the mod.
 - Other metadata content that should be updated remotely without a mod update being necessary.
 - An Hypixel API Proxy with a dedicated API Key created for DarkAddons for use in the mod (Likely not going to be done unless we swap to a paid tier as Netlify Free tier only allows static sites).

Hence, the above list is essentially a todo-list, but it's all long term goals and we are just only bumping a commit for each release of the mod at the moment and not doing much work in this repository. Feel free to give the main mod's repository a visit, though: https://github.com/TheDGOfficial/DarkAddons
